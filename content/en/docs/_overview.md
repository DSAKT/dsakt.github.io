## **What is DSA.kt?**

**DSA.kt** is a comprehensive platform for learning **Data Structures & Algorithms in Kotlin**. This site aims to make complex concepts in algorithms and data structures more accessible, especially for those who want to implement solutions using **Kotlin**.

Kotlin is a modern language that is growing in popularity, particularly for Android development. While many resources cover general algorithms and data structures, they often focus on language-agnostic explanations, which can make it harder to find **Kotlin-specific solutions**. **DSA.kt** bridges this gap by offering solutions with **Kotlin code examples**, helping Kotlin enthusiasts learn and apply algorithms with the language’s unique features, including **extension functions** and **null safety**.



## **Why I Created This**

There are plenty of tutorials available on Data Structures and Algorithms, but most of them are language-agnostic, focusing on concepts rather than implementation in specific languages. For Kotlin developers, finding detailed DSA tutorials that also incorporate Kotlin's unique syntax and features can be challenging.

**DSA.kt** was created to solve this problem. The aim is to provide in-depth tutorials with a **Kotlin-first approach**, emphasizing **Kotlin-specific features**, like its **extension functions**, which allow developers to write more concise, readable, and efficient code. Whether you’re preparing for coding interviews or looking to improve your problem-solving skills, this site offers Kotlin-centric solutions that will help you write less code and understand algorithms deeply.

## **What It'll Cover**

### Data Structures
- Comprehensive coverage of **Kotlin data structures** with examples.
- Insights into **compatibility with Java** and equivalent Java implementations.
- Real-world use cases to understand when and where to use each structure.

### Algorithms
- Clear explanations of **commonly used algorithms**, including sorting, searching, dynamic programming, and graph traversal.
- Code syntax and examples written in Kotlin.
- Side-by-side **Java examples** for easy comparison and interoperability.

### Problem Solving
- Step-by-step solutions to popular **LeetCode problems**.
- Instructions and guides for approaching and solving algorithmic challenges.
- Clean and efficient **Kotlin code** implementations, ready for interviews or projects.
