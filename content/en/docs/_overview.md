## What is DSA.kt?

**DSA.kt** is a comprehensive platform for learning **Data Structures & Algorithms in Kotlin**. This site aims to make complex concepts in algorithms and data structures more accessible, especially for those who want to implement solutions using **Kotlin**.

Kotlin is a modern language that is growing in popularity, particularly for Android development. While many resources cover general algorithms and data structures, they often focus on language-agnostic explanations, which can make it harder to find **Kotlin-specific solutions**. **DSA.kt** bridges this gap by offering solutions with **Kotlin code examples**, helping Kotlin enthusiasts learn and apply algorithms with the language’s unique features, including **extension functions** and **null safety**.



## Why I Created This

There are plenty of tutorials available on Data Structures and Algorithms, but most of them are language-agnostic, focusing on concepts rather than implementation in specific languages. For Kotlin developers, finding detailed DSA tutorials that also incorporate Kotlin's unique syntax and features can be challenging.

**DSA.kt** was created to solve this problem. The aim is to provide in-depth tutorials with a **Kotlin-first approach**, emphasizing **Kotlin-specific features**, like its **extension functions**, which allow developers to write more concise, readable, and efficient code. Whether you’re preparing for coding interviews or looking to improve your problem-solving skills, this site offers Kotlin-centric solutions that will help you write less code and understand algorithms deeply.



## Credits
Thanks to the following tools and platforms for making this project possible:
- **Hugo** for providing the platform for this site.
- **E25DX** for creating the Hugo theme used in this project.
- **GitHub** for providing the platform for version control and collaboration.
- **GitHub Pages** for hosting this site for free, making it easy for anyone to access and contribute.



## How Can You Contribute?

We believe in the power of community and open-source collaboration. If you’d like to contribute to **DSA.kt**, here’s how you can help:

1. **Fork this repository** and make your changes.
2. **Submit a pull request** with your improvements or additions.
3. **Create an Issue** if you spot any bugs or have suggestions for new content.
