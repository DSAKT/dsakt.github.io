## **Pair and Triple in Kotlin**

In Kotlin, **`Pair`** and **`Triple`** are simple data structures provided by the standard library to hold two or three related objects respectively. These classes are commonly used to group data without the need to define custom data classes.

### **Pair**

`Pair<A, B>` is a structure used to store two related objects of types `A` and `B`. It is especially useful when you need to return two values from a function or temporarily group two objects.

#### **Creating a Pair**

```kotlin
val pair = Pair("John", 25)
println(pair.first)  // Output: John
println(pair.second) // Output: 25
```

#### **Destructuring a Pair**

You can destructure a `Pair` into two separate variables:

```kotlin
val (name, age) = Pair("John", 25)
println(name)  // Output: John
println(age)   // Output: 25
```

#### **Example: Returning Two Values from a Function**

```kotlin
fun getPersonInfo(): Pair<String, Int> {
    return Pair("Alice", 30)
}

val (name, age) = getPersonInfo()
println("Name: $name, Age: $age")  // Output: Name: Alice, Age: 30
```

### **Triple**

`Triple<A, B, C>` is a structure used to store three related objects of types `A`, `B`, and `C`. It can be used in situations where you need to return or group three objects.

#### **Creating a Triple**

```kotlin
val triple = Triple("John", 25, "Engineer")
println(triple.first)   // Output: John
println(triple.second)  // Output: 25
println(triple.third)   // Output: Engineer
```

#### **Destructuring a Triple**

You can destructure a `Triple` into three separate variables:

```kotlin
val (name, age, profession) = Triple("John", 25, "Engineer")
println(name)        // Output: John
println(age)         // Output: 25
println(profession)  // Output: Engineer
```

#### **Example: Returning Three Values from a Function**

```kotlin
fun getEmployeeInfo(): Triple<String, Int, String> {
    return Triple("Alice", 30, "Manager")
}

val (name, age, role) = getEmployeeInfo()
println("Name: $name, Age: $age, Role: $role")
// Output: Name: Alice, Age: 30, Role: Manager
```

### **Use Cases**

- **`Pair`**: Use for simple associations between two objects, such as a key-value pair or coordinate points.
- **`Triple`**: Use when three objects need to be grouped together temporarily, such as returning multiple attributes from a function.

### **Key Points**

- `Pair` and `Triple` are immutable and simple to use.
- For more complex use cases, consider defining a custom data class for better readability and maintainability.

#### **Performance Note**

While `Pair` and `Triple` are convenient, they are less descriptive than named properties in a custom data class. Use them for temporary or small-scale tasks where defining a data class might be overkill.

### **Conclusion**

`Pair` and `Triple` are versatile tools for quickly grouping two or three related objects in Kotlin. They provide built-in destructuring and are easy to use for temporary tasks or simple use cases. For more structured or descriptive data, custom data classes are recommended.
